The Zesty SDK allows developers to integrate their app into the Zesty Network. Please go to https://docs.zesty.market for more documentation.

## What's Zesty?

Zesty is an open and permissionless monetization protocol for creators of AR/VR experiences. It is open in the sense that anyone can integrate our SDK to monetize their apps, without the permission of a centralized authority.

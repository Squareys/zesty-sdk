The Zesty SDK allows developers to integrate their app into the Zesty Network. For more documentation: https://docs.zesty.market

## What's Zesty?

Zesty is an open and permissionless monetization protocol for creators of AR/VR experiences. It is open in the sense that anyone can integrate our SDK to monetize their apps, without the permission of a centralized authority.

## Analytics

The Zesty SDK will collect analytics to give advertisers and publishers an indication of the the performance of the ads. As is verifiable throughout our codebase, we take care to ensure that no personally identifiable information (PII) is recorded.

For more info on description of the kind of data that is collected, refer to the [Analytics](https://docs.zesty.market/data/analytics) section of our docs.
